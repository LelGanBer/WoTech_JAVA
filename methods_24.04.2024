METHODS

// method == function (it is one and the same but with different names
// we can write this code whenever we want - or at the beginning or at the end
// void == returns nothing; this is just an action

```java
public class Main {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    printOutABorder();
    
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
    int number = getARandomNumber();
    System.out.println(number);
    printOutABorder();
  }


  public static void printOutABorder() {
    //Function starts here
    System.out.println("=====================");
    //Function ends here
  }

  public static int getARandomNumber() {
    //Function starts here
    return 5;
    //Function ends here
  }
}

// void == Returns nothing; This is just an action
 ```java


PAR METHODS NO ALEX LEE VIDEO:

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){

    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    System.out.println(a*b);



-Access modifiers:
//public
//private
//protected

-Whether or not the function is static:
//static

-Return type:
//void
//int
//String
//int[]
//boolean
//... ...


THESE TWO CODES ARE THE SAME:
1)
public class Main {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number1 = 5;
    int number2 = 7;
    int result = sum(number1, number2);
    System.out.println(result);
  }


  public static int sum (int number1, int number2) {
    return number1 + number2;
  }
}
2)
public class Main {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number1 = 5;
    int number2 = 7;
    int result = number1 + number2;
    System.out.println(result);
  }
}

ONE OF OSKARS EXAMPLE:
/*
  Write a name and check whether or not it is atleast 3 char long
   Write a surname and check whether or not it is atleast 3 char long
If it's not, then say. Sorry, your name is too short.
If both of them are valid, say. Thank you, your information has been registered!
*/

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){

    String name = "a";
    String surname = "Klaumanis";
    boolean isUserNameValid = isNameValid(name); // Give the function "Oskars" as an argument
    //Because Oskars is longer than 3, isUserNameValid = true
    
    boolean isUserSurnameValid = isNameValid(surname); // Give the function "Klaumanis" as an argument
    //Because Klaumanis is longer than 3, isUserSurnameValid = true

    if(isUserNameValid && isUserSurnameValid){
      System.out.println("Thank you, your information has been registered!");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Sorry, your check your information");
    }
    
  }

  public static boolean isNameValid(String name){ //name == "Klaumanis"
    if(name.length() < 3){ //Checking whether or not "Klaumanis" length is less than 3
      System.out.println("Sorry, your name is too short.");
      return false;
    }

    return true; //Because "Klaumanis" length is more than 3, we return true
  }
}

GROUP TASKS:

Easy:

Sum of 2 numbers
User provides 2 numbers
Result is a sum of those numbers

Example: 
User inputs 5
User inputs 6
Result: 11

Hard:
1. Create a program, where user can provide a title and a small text below the story.
Title should be wrapped with ====== at top and bottom, based on the title length.
Example: 
System asks for title and user provides "WoTech and Java is easy"
System asks for description and user provides "I have been learning Java for 6 weeks now."

Result: 
=======================
WoTech and Java is easy
=======================

I have been learning Java for 6 weeks now.
