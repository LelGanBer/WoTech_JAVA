GROUP TASK:

Easy -> Initialize a string array and try to input and output data
     We want to define an array city names.
     We want to add values to it (could be through the scanner, or just writing 

arr[0] = "Riga";

java
arr[0] = scanner.nextLine();




public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  String [] arr = new String[5];
  arr[0] = "Riga";
  arr[1] = "Tallinn";
  arr[2] = "Vilnius";
  arr[3] = "Paris";
  arr[4] = "Milan";

  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      
  System.out.println(arr[i]);
    
    } 
  }
}


A step by step solution to the largest number (I will give hints only for largest number, but the solution for both are the same)

    Define an int array that is x amounts large


 1.1. Put values in the array 

    Define an int variable called maxNumber, this is where we store the value of largest number


 2.1. The value of maxNumber should be the first value of the array

    Go through the array with a loop


 3.1. If the i number is bigger than the maxNumber, we need to change the value of maxNumber to i
 3.2. Repeat  3.1. on the next cycle until the end of the array

    Print out - "Largest number of array is " + maxNumber
